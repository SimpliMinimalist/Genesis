# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that serves as a template for future projects. It includes a basic structure with a home screen, a store screen, and a profile screen. The application is built with a focus on a clean, scalable, and maintainable architecture.

## Features

* **Navigation:** The application uses a styled bottom navigation bar to switch between the main screens.
* **Theming:** The application supports both light and dark themes, with the ability to toggle between them. The system navigation bar's background now matches the app's background.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

* `lib/core`: Contains the core components of the application, such as navigation, services, and themes.
* `lib/features`: Contains the different features of the application, such as home, profile, and store.
* `lib/app.dart`: The main application widget.
* `lib/main.dart`: The entry point of the application.

## Status

Base setup is complete.
